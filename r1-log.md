# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Bryan Castleman

### My personal 100 Day Goal 
- I want to build a strong case for myself to become employed as a Front End Developer, strengthen my portfolio, and solidify my understanding of certain skills.

#### I want to grow and solidify my understanding of the following things: 
1. CSS3 (CSS Grid, Flexbox, variables, etc.)
2. javaScript ES6 / jQuery
3. CSS Preprocessing 
4. Task Runner Experience (Gulp) 
5. Responsive Design
6. Node.js and NPM packages
7. Front-end templating (Handlebars or Pug)
8. UI/UX 
9. React / Redux 
10. JSON, AJAX, lazy-loading concepts and implementation methods
11. CSS Animations and javascript GSAP (Greensock Animation Platform)
12. Wordpress Development & PHP

### Day 16: April 27, 2018

**Focus**: (Goal #1 Flexbox, Goal #3 CSS Preprocessing)

**Today's Progress**: I built a large portion of the responsive layout which will be translated into a custom theme in Wordpress.  

**Thoughts**: Flexbox and CSS Grid are amazing layout tools.

### Day 15: April 27, 2018

**Focus**: (Goal #12 Wordpress Development & PHP)

**Today's Progress** I learned more about the variety of Wordpress functions I could employ, and about dynamic navigation in WP

**Thoughts**: At this point, I think I want to try to code things and utilize a Wordpress Cheat Sheet to see if I can solve problems on my own. 

### Day 14: April 26, 2018

**Focus**: (Goal #1 CSS Grid and Flexbox,#3 Sass, #5 Responsive Design)  

**Today's Progress**: Started building the dance studio layout in HTML and CSS. Used Sass partials for the first time and changed the Gulp task to compile all scss files into one CSS file.

**Thoughts**: Building projects for real clients offers more real world challenges, and will be better for my portfolio since I have very little experience on my resume.

### Day 13: April 25, 2018

**Focus**: (Goal #4 Gulp, Goal #3 Sass, Goal #8 UI/UX , #12 WordPress Development & PHP)  

**Today's Progress**: Have a basic outline of the new website established and some components established. 

**Thoughts**: Trying to design a new UI/UX for a Dance Studio website. So far most of the work has been in pencil and paper, organizing the disarray of the current website. The rest of the time has been studying Wordpress development and PHP so I can add a custom theme. 

### Day 12: April 24, 2018

**Focus**: (Goal #13 JavaScript)  

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed the filter, map, and reduce JavaScript methods. I also spent some time reading about aspects of a Free Code Camp Advanced Algorithm challenge called 'No Repeat'.   

**Thoughts**: 


### Day 11: April 23, 2018

**Focus**: (Goal #12) Wordpress Development & PHP 

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to write PHP variables, functions, and loops. I'm also learning how to integrate my own layouts in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into Wordpress. 

**Thoughts**: I'm hoping to go through this video series quickly so that I can build this site fast and move on to another project in React or Vue.

### Day 10: April 21, 2018

**Focus**: (Goal #2, #5, #9) JavaScript & HTML, Flexbox, and React 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I solved an algorithm challege on Codewars using Array.prototype.reduce().
2. I continued working with Flexbox properties in a responsive portfolio layout by adding new pages.
3. I cloned a friend's github repo, to see if I can help solve her problems in her React application.  

**Thoughts**: I am happy to finally implement the reduce method. I am trying to understand the philosophy behind building React applications vs. web applications built in other ways. I spent a lot of time today diagramming the component structure of the React version of the responsive portfolio.

### Day 9: April 20, 2018

**Focus**: (Goal #9) React

**Today's Progress**: I began to set up state in my latest React project.

**Thoughts**: Throughout this building process I'm questioning how I can better diagram out the entire application on paper.

### Day 8: April 19, 2018

**Focus**: (Goal #9) React

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to learn ReactJS, and about passing static props from a parent to a child.   

**Thoughts**: I'm able to build a responsive portfolio website with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. However, rebuilding the same thing in ReactJS is very different process. 
- In order to utilize Font Awesome an npm package is required. 
- I also need to be able to replace animations created by jQuery.

### Day 7: April 18, 2018

**Focus**: (Goal #2) JavaScript

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to use the JavaScript array [reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) method. 

**Thoughts**: Learning 'higher-order functions' such as filter, map, and reduce method is a major step forward for me as a JavaScript developer. I am going to incorporate these into my code as much as possible.

### Day 6: April 17, 2018

**Focus**: (Goal #2) JavaScript

**Today's Progress**: Realizing that I need to learn the JavaScript reduce() method. 

I made progress on re-writing my Front End Developer résumé. 

**Thoughts**: I realized that I had already solved the Map the Debris algorithm challenge back in October 2017, so I worked on another one called [Exact Change](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/exact-change). After struggling to find a solution to the Advanced Algorithm challenge, I read the hints provided. I realized that the solution to the problem used the reduce method which I don't fully understand. I really want to solve the problem for myself, and I will revisit this to complete on another day.

### Day 5: April 16, 2018

**Focus**: (Goals #2 & #11) JavaScript & GSAP (Greensock Animation Platform)

**Today's Progress**: I got GSAP set up in my project, and animated an element on the screen. 

**Thoughts**: I watched [Getting Started with GSAP (Greensock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/get-started-js) and was able to get GSAP working locally. I spent most of my day trying to figure out if I could animate or tween Flexbox property changes. I was unsuccesful in that regard. I plan to incorporate GSAP into my coding repertoire.

### Day 4: April 14, 2018

**Focus**: (Goal #1) CSS3 (CSS Grid, Flexbox, variables, etc.)

**Today's Progress**: I gained a deeper understanding of flexbox properties by building something that demonstrates them visually.  

**Thoughts**: I initially wanted to animate one flexbox property change to another, but learned that this is more difficult than I imagined it would be. I know it is possible with a library like Greensock. I want to make it work on all device sizes and add animations. I also want to add more flexbox properties and values.

### Day 3: April 13, 2018

**Focus**: (Goals #3 & #4) Sass & Gulp.js

**Today's Progress**: I wrote and used to gulp tasks succesfully. I was able to compile SCSS to CSS and have file changes automatically compiled with every file save. 

**Thoughts**: I am happy about learning gulp. This was a mini milestone in my personal goals to become an employed Front End Developer. I was able to write more Sass too.

### Day 2: April 12, 2018

**Focus**: (Goal #1) CSS3

**Today's Progress**: I learned more about the CSS box-shadow property and positioning elements to make use of the Z-axis with z-index. 

**Thoughts**: After watching videos on Material Design. I made a quick project to practice the CSS box-shadow, CSS z-index property, and element positioning. Here is the Github repo.

### Day 1: April 11, 2018

**Focus**: (Goal #2) CSS Preprocesser

**Today's Progress**: I wrote my first Sass and compiled it to CSS. 

**Thoughts:** I wanted to get some experience writing SCSS and compiling it to CSS. I also wanted to practice CSS Animation. I compiled with a command every time I made changes. I would like to try gulp to take care of this for me.
