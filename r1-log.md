# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Bryan Castleman

## 100 Day Goal
I want to build a strong case for myself to become employed as a Front End Developer. 

#### I want to grow and solidy my understanding of the following things: 
1. CSS3 (CSS Grid, Flexbox, variables, etc.)
2. javaScript / jQuery
3. CSS Preprocessing 
4. Task Runner Experience (Gulp) 
5. Responsive Design
6. Node.js and NPM packages
7. CSS Animations and javascript GSAP (Greensock Animation Platform)
8. UI/UX 
9. React
10. JSON, AJAX, lazy-loading concepts and implementation methods

### Day 1: April 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I wrote Sass and compiled it to CSS. 

**Thoughts:** I wanted to get some experience writing SCSS and compiling it to CSS. I also wanted to practice CSS Animation. I compiled with a command every time I made changes. I would like to try gulp to take care of this for me. 

**Link to work:** [Animated Spinner](https://castlemaninc.github.io/spinner/)

### Day 2: April 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I learned more about the CSS box-shadow property and positioning elements to make use of the Z-axis with z-index. 

**Thoughts**: After watching videos on Material Design. I made a quick project to practice the CSS box-shadow, CSS z-index property, and element positioning. Here is the Github repo.

### Day 3: April 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrote and used to gulp tasks succesfully. I was able to compile SCSS to CSS and have file changes automatically compiled with every file save. 

**Thoughts**: I am happy about learning gulp. This was a mini milestone in my personal goals to become an employed Front End Developer. I was able to write more Sass too.

### Day 4: April 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I gained a deeper understanding of flexbox properties by building something that demonstrates them visually.  

**Thoughts**: I initially wanted to animate one flexbox property change to another, but learned that this is more difficult than I imagined it would be. I know it is possible with a library like Greensock. I want to make it work on all device sizes and add animations. I also want to add more flexbox properties and values.

### Day 5: April 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I got GSAP set up in my project, and animated an element on the screen. 

**Thoughts**: I watched [Getting Started with GSAP (Greensock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/get-started-js) and was able to get GSAP working locally. I spent most of my day trying to figure out if I could animate or tween Flexbox property changes. I was unsuccesful in that regard. I plan to incorporate GSAP into my coding repertoire.
