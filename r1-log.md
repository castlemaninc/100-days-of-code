# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Bryan Castleman

### My personal 100 Day Goal 
#### (This was added on April 20, 2018 to give myself some structure for the remaining 91 days.)
I want to build a strong case for myself to become employed as a Front End Developer, strengthen my portfolio, and solidify my understanding of certain skills.

#### I want to grow and solidify my understanding of the following things: 
1. CSS3 (CSS Grid, Flexbox, variables, etc.)
2. javaScript / jQuery
3. CSS Preprocessing 
4. Task Runner Experience (Gulp) 
5. Responsive Design
6. Node.js and NPM packages
7. Front-end templating (Handlebars or Pug)
8. UI/UX 
9. React
10. JSON, AJAX, lazy-loading concepts and implementation methods
11. CSS Animations and javascript GSAP (Greensock Animation Platform)

### Day 1: April 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I wrote Sass and compiled it to CSS. 

**Thoughts:** I wanted to get some experience writing SCSS and compiling it to CSS. I also wanted to practice CSS Animation. I compiled with a command every time I made changes. I would like to try gulp to take care of this for me.

### Day 2: April 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I learned more about the CSS box-shadow property and positioning elements to make use of the Z-axis with z-index. 

**Thoughts**: After watching videos on Material Design. I made a quick project to practice the CSS box-shadow, CSS z-index property, and element positioning. Here is the Github repo.

### Day 3: April 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrote and used to gulp tasks succesfully. I was able to compile SCSS to CSS and have file changes automatically compiled with every file save. 

**Thoughts**: I am happy about learning gulp. This was a mini milestone in my personal goals to become an employed Front End Developer. I was able to write more Sass too.

### Day 4: April 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I gained a deeper understanding of flexbox properties by building something that demonstrates them visually.  

**Thoughts**: I initially wanted to animate one flexbox property change to another, but learned that this is more difficult than I imagined it would be. I know it is possible with a library like Greensock. I want to make it work on all device sizes and add animations. I also want to add more flexbox properties and values.

### Day 5: April 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I got GSAP set up in my project, and animated an element on the screen. 

**Thoughts**: I watched [Getting Started with GSAP (Greensock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/get-started-js) and was able to get GSAP working locally. I spent most of my day trying to figure out if I could animate or tween Flexbox property changes. I was unsuccesful in that regard. I plan to incorporate GSAP into my coding repertoire.

### Day 6: April 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Realizing that I need to learn the JavaScript reduce() method. 

I made progress on re-writing my Front End Developer résumé. 

**Thoughts**: I realized that I had already solved the Map the Debris algorithm challenge back in October 2017, so I worked on another one called [Exact Change](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/exact-change). After struggling to find a solution to the Advanced Algorithm challenge, I read the hints provided. I realized that the solution to the problem used the reduce method which I don't fully understand. I really want to solve the problem for myself, and I will revisit this to complete on another day.

### Day 7: April 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to use the JavaScript array [reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) method. 

**Thoughts**: Learning 'higher-order functions' such as filter, map, and reduce method is a major step forward for me as a JavaScript developer. I am going to incorporate these into my code as much as possible. 

### Day 8: April 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to learn ReactJS, and about passing static props from a parent to a child.   

**Thoughts**: I'm able to build a responsive portfolio website with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. However, rebuilding the same thing in ReactJS is very different process. 
- In order to utilize Font Awesome an npm package is required. 
- I also need to be able to replace animations created by jQuery.
